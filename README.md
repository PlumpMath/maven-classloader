## maven-classloader

Given a Maven GAV, the Maven Classloader will resolve and download all dependencies from local and remote maven repositories.

This library utilizes [Sonatype Aether][1], the library used by Maven to deal with repositories. Aether does all of the heavy lifting, this library aims to be a lightweight shim on top of it to help reduce the friction for a majority of potential uses.

### Getting Started

Coming soon.
